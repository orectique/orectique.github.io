## Objective

I stand at the intersection of rigorous policy analysis and data science, employing intricate microsimulation models to explore variations human behavior in response to policy interventions. My academic pursuits have encompassed dissecting the distributional effects of Australian tax cuts and mapping the spatial scope of social unrest, revealing patterns and truths embedded within complex datasets. Through research work at Mandala Partners and QuantEcon, I've honed my analytical skills and cultivated a collaborative spirit. Now, with a proven track record of leading data analysis teams, I seek to apply my expertise to pressing policy challenges at think tanks, leveraging data to inform actionable strategies.
